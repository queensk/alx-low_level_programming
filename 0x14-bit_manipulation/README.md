# Bit manipulation
The bit manipulation in c

## About
This project is about manipulations of bits in c.
- 0-binary_to_uint.c → Converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- 1-print_binary.c → Prints the binary representation of a number.
- 2-get_bit.c → Returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- 3-set_bit.c → Sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- 4-clear_bit.c → Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
- 5-flip_bits.c → Returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Advanced
- 100-get_endianness.c → Checks the endianness.
- 101-password → Find the password for this program.
